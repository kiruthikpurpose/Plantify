# Plantify

**Plantify** is a simple website where users can upload an image of a plant and identify it using Artificial Intelligence, powered by Google Gemini API. This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT, which helped in planning, debugging, and writing the code, even though I had limited knowledge of coding in Next.js 14. Once an image is uploaded, the AI will analyze it and display the plantâ€™s name and detailed information right below the uploaded image.

## Features

- **Upload an Image:** You can select a file from your device to upload.
- **Plant Identification:** After uploading, the website uses the Google Gemini API to identify the plant.
- **Display Plant Information:** Once the plant is identified, its name, scientific name, and other relevant information are displayed below the image.

## Example Output

**Umbrella Tree**  
_Schefflera actinophylla_  

The umbrella tree, also known as the octopus tree or Australian umbrella tree, is a popular indoor plant known for its large, umbrella-shaped leaves. Native to Australia, it is a fast-growing evergreen that can tolerate a range of light conditions. The umbrella tree is known for its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that can grow up to 16 inches in diameter. The plant can grow up to 10 feet tall indoors but is often pruned to keep it at a manageable size.

**Plant Details:**
- Family: Araliaceae
- Native Region: Australia
- Growth Habit: Shrub
- Flower Color: Red
- Leaf Type: Compound

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14** for building the website.
